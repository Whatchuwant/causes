<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>
The Elephant Cause is a unique project set in Chiang Mai province, Northern Thailand. Established in the 1990's our aim has always been to provide a sanctuary and rescue centre for elephants. The park is located some 60km from the city, and has provided a sanctuary for dozens of distressed elephants from all over Thailand.</p>

<h3>Elephant Nature Park Mission Statement</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Sanctuary for endangered species: We provide homes for these animals as well as contributing to their welfare and development.</li>
	<li>Rain Forest Restoration: One of the most exciting developments at the park is our programme of tree planting the surrounding area. The ecological balance of plants and animals will be encouraged by the re-introduction of the rain forest. Some 25 acres of the mountainside will be planted every year for the first 5 years.</li>
	<li>Cultural Preservation: To maintain, as much as possible, the cultural integrity of the local community. By creating employment and purchasing agricultural products locally we are assisting the villagers in sustaining their distinct culture. Park managers are recruited locally to oversee the park's progress.</li>
	<li>Visitors Education : To educate visitors, individuals, study groups, schools and interested parties. Emphasis on the plight of the endangered local species will be presented in an entertaining and constructive manner. Future phases will include audio / visual equipment and other modern educational aids. It is anticipated that small conferences and workshops will be organised at the park.</li>
	<li>Act independently : of pressure groups and political movements that we consider contrary to the well being of the park and the creatures in its care.</li>
</ol>
