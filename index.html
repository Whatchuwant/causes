<h1>The Elephant Cause</h1>
<h2>They're People Too!</h2>

<p>The Elephant Cause is an elephant rescue and rehabilitation center in Northern Thailand where you can volunteer and visit to help.We have been involved in dozens of rescues which have created our thriving elephant herd. The park provides a natural environment for elephants, dogs, cats, buffaloes and many other animals under our care.
Volunteers and visitors contribute to the healing while learning about their lives past and present. Arrange a visit to all our projects in Thailand, Cambodia and Myanmar.</p>
